# Arabic_VirualAssistant

This project aims to develop an AI chatbot trained on Arabic-language data. It leverages advanced techniques in natural language processing (NLP) to enable the model to understand and generate human-like responses in Arabic. The chatbot utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models from Hugging Face, with fine-tuning on a custom Arabic dataset for improved conversational accuracy and context retention.

# Key features include:

## Language Understanding:
The model is trained specifically on Arabic text data, enabling it to comprehend regional dialects, cultural nuances, and provide relevant answers.
## Fine-Tuning: 
Uses techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which allows the model to perform well with less computational cost.
## Easy Integration: 
The chatbot can be integrated into websites, messaging platforms, or custom applications for real-time interaction.
## Optimized Performance: 
Efficient memory usage and fast inference are achieved through careful optimization, including the use of BitsAndBytes for quantization.
